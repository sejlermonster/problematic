\chapter{Requirements}
The AreaAware HQ system creates situational awareness for Emergency Commanders. This is secured by giving the Emergency Commander a demografic overview of the situation. The overview show registered events from Emergency Responders and other Emergency Commanders. The system also facilities fast and secure communication with Emergency Responders.

The AreaAware system realizes that a civil crisis is of great importance and that securing fast and safe communication throughout the crisis is of the highest priority. The AreaAware system secures the best network coverage throughout the world by supporting both SINE/TELTRA Network and commercial internet. A crisis situation can result in the commercial internet not being operational. By using both SINE and commercial internet AreaAware makes sure that communication between Emergency Commanders and Emergency Responders can always get through. The SINE network also allows for prioritizing communication and will secure communication between Emergency Commanders and Emergency Responders.

\section{Scope}
The goal of the system is to handle civilian crisis's in a more effective way. This should be done by giving the Emergency Commander a Common Operational Picture to give situational awareness and support the Emergency Commander in the better communication with Emergency Responders in the field

\subsection{Identification}
To support the goal defined in the scope AreaAware Hq will be developed. Based on the goal a system that gives the Emergency Commander a common operational picture (COP) will be described throughout this document. The COP should give the Emergency Commander situational awareness and the ability to command Emergency Responders during a civilian crisis. 

This section includes a full identification of the system-of-interest to which this document applies.
\myFigure{actorContextDiagram.png}{Actor context diagram}{asdfq}{0.7} 

AreaAware Hq will only include a development of the Common operation picture which will communicate with devices already used in civil crisis scenarios. AreaAware Hq will communicate over the defined standard network used in these scenarios. This network is called SINE(Sikkerhednetv√¶rket) and it follows an international standard for communication called TETRA which is used during crisis situations world wide. 

\subsection{System overview}
The system will facilitate the Emergency Commander in:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Give a demographic overview of the crisis area
	\item Let the Emergency Commander locate events, things of interest and actors in the area.
	\item Let the Emergency Commander send commands to actors in the area.
\end{itemize}

The system developed will contain of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A web application that can be accessed over the internet
	\item Communication Modem that connects already used computer system by Emergency Commanders to both SINE network and Internet.
\end{itemize}

AreaAware HQ will be accessed as a web application from systems already used by the Emergency Commander at the mobile headquarter. This will allow the Emergency Commander to gain situational awareness through a structured map that show relevant events for the Emergency Commander. The System will also allow for communication to Emergency Responders who are working in the field during a civil crisis.

As a part of the AreaAware HQ a Communication Modem is developed. This allows already used computer systems at the mobile headquarters to gain access to both the SINE network and internet access. The Communication model will prioritize communication on the available network with the best bandwidth. This allows for a network coverage during a civil crisis through the SINE network but also allow for higher networks speeds through the internet if possible.

\subsection{Document overview}
\label{sec_documentOverview}
This document will describe the functional and non-functional requirement of the system of interest. 

The functional requirements are described using Task descriptions in section \ref{sec_functional}. These requirements describes what the system should be able to do. Task descriptions includes a Task name, the purpose of the Task and might include a precondition for the Task. The purpose should reflect the goals stated. The Tasks are furthermore described with sub-tasks that elaborates on the behaviour of the system and user.  Variants are described to explain alternatives to the main sub-tasks. \citep{taskDescription}

The non-functional requirements are divided up in sub-sections and categorized. The following sections describes the non-functional requirements of the system: \ref{sec_nonFunc1}, \ref{sec_nonFunc2}, \ref{sec_nonFunc3}, \ref{sec_nonFunc4}, \ref{sec_nonFunc5}, \ref{sec_nonFunc6} and \ref{sec_nonFunc7} 
 

%\section{Required states and modes}
%If the system is required to operate in multiple states or modes, these states and modes shall be defined.

\section{System external interface requirements}
This section will describe the system‚Äôs external interfaces. Interfaces will be assigned a project-unique identifier. 

The system will communicate over the network used by the Emergency Responders during a civil crisis. This network is called SINE. The interface will be provided by SINE and AreaAware HQ will follow the given interface to allow for SINE certification. AreaAware HQ will also make it possible to extend the capabilities of the SINE network by using the internet to extend the network. The AreaAware Hq Communication Model will be used to extend the possibilities of SINE and also use the internet to communicate with Emergency Responders.

The diagram shown on figure \ref{fig:externalInterface} explains the external interfaces of AreaAware Hq.

\subsection{Software Warranty Service consists of:}
Defect Reporting. For Critical Defects, the Customer will have 24x7 access to the Service Centre by e-mail or phone to request defect repair, as described below. ‚ÄúCritical Defect means that the
application is down or is at high risk, business functions cannot be conducted, or the Customer is experiencing continual failures or data corruption as a result of the defect. To report non-critical
defects, the Customer will have e-mail or phone access to the Service Centre during the Principal Period of Maintenance (‚ÄùPPM‚Äù), which is 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., local time, Monday through Friday,
excluding local holidays. Defect Repair. Defect repair includes verification of the existence of a defect, determination of the
severity or impact of the defect, and determination of the conditions under which the defect may recur. 
The Company will, at its option: 
\begin{itemize}
\item For a Critical Defect, commence action within a 2-shift hour response window using commercially reasonable efforts to provide an immediate fix or temporary solution of, or workaround
to, the defect.
\item For a non-critical defect, commence action within an 8-shift hour response window to provide either the action described for a Critical Defect or a statement that the defect will be corrected
in a software product revision or a future software release.
\item Provide a statement that the Software operates as described in then-current user documentation or that the defect arises when such Software is used other than in a manner for which it
was designed. For Software added to an installed System, warranty service must be upgraded to the same software support plan, if any, as that of the Software already installed on that
System. Customer will pay the difference between standard warranty and upgraded warranty
service.
