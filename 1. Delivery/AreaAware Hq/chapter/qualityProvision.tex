For each requirement explained in chapter \ref{chp_requirements} this chapter will define qualification methods on how verification shall be done.

The chapter contains two tables, one for descriping the different qualification methods, and the other descriping how each requirement is qualified.

\begin{longtable}{| p{4.2cm}  | p{7.8cm} |  }
