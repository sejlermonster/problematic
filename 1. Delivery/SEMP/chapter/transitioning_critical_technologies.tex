\chapter{Transitioning critical technologies}
\label{chp:trans_crit_tech}
This chapter will focus on some critical technologies mentioned in both System Requirement specifications (\srshq{} \& \srsdis) and the design decision document (\pdd).

\section{Critical technologies and the risk hereof}
\subsection{SINE network}
The SINE network can be considered a critical technology, because it is a rather big part the functional design of the AreaAware system.
But the SINE network it self is constrained to a small market, namely Denmark.

\subsubsection{Risks of the SINE network}
The design of the AreaAware system only describes the use of the SINE network and commercial internet.
This highly reduces the potential market for AreaAware and the income that such a system could bring to Problematic.\\
If the system design does not allow for an easy change to other or additional forms of networks the AreaAware system will lead to a large deficit for the project.\\
Therefore it can not be emphasized enough that the AreaAware design should allow for easy extension of supported network types in order to meet a larger market.
