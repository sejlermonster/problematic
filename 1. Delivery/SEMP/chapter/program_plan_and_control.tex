\label{chp:program_plan}


\section{Statements of Work (SOW)}
The main purpose of the SOW is to define liabilities, responsibilities and work agreements between client and service providers.

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:sow_intro}
In a military battlefield the \emph{SitaWare Suite} provides the capability to establish situational awareness, what in other settings may be referred to as a common operations picture (COP).
The project AreaAware wishes to extend these possibilities offered by \emph{SitaWare Suite} to cover civilian scenarios, where actors for police, armed forces, hospitals and emergency management work together to control a crisis situation.
A successful result of this could be a scenario where the commanders from a mobile headquarter can evaluate incoming information, act upon it and possibly dispatch orders or information to relevant actors to respond to by.

\subsection{Objectives}
The objective of Project AreaAware is to deliver a solution capable of fulfilling the successful result described above in \ref{sec:sow_intro}.

\subsection{Scope of Work}

\section{Organization Structure}
AreaWare will be designed by Problematic in cooperation with the projects stakeholders.
The full product will be developed by development team of Problematic and by one subcontractor.
The development team will have at least one system engineer associated under the development.

The system engineer role is to ensure the project are following all the norms and requirements listed in the SEMP and \todo{Kravspec}, aswell to support all members of the project regarding design and process.
The system engineer should also continue write and update all relevant system engineering document for the project.

The development team role is to implement AreaAware as it is described by the system engineer(s).
The team consists of various fields, including software architects, software engineers and test engineers.\\

The subcontractor will have one system engineer from Problematic to ensure projects are following all norms and requirements listen the SEMP and \todo{Kravspec}, aswell supporting in case of questions regarding the design and process of the project.
