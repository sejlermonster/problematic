\section{Statements of Work (SOW)}
The main purpose of the SOW is to define liabilities, responsibilities and work agreements between client and service providers.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec:sow_intro}
In a military battlefield the \emph{SitaWare Suite} provides the capability to establish situational awareness, what in other settings may be referred to as a common operations picture (COP).
The project AreaAware wishes to extend these possibilities offered by \emph{SitaWare Suite} to cover civilian scenarios, where actors for police, armed forces, hospitals and emergency management work together to control a crisis situation.
A successful result of this could be a scenario where the commanders from a mobile headquarter can evaluate incoming information, act upon it and possibly dispatch orders or information to relevant actors to respond to by.

\subsection{Objectives}
The objective of Project AreaAware is to deliver a solution capable of fulfilling the successful result described above in \ref{sec:sow_intro}.

\subsection{Scope of Work}
A solution using the \emph{SitaWare Suite}, running on mobile platform.
