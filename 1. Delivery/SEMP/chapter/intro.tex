\section{Scope}
This document is applicable to the AreaAware system, all subsystems and component engineering efforts accomplished throughout the case.

\section{Purpose}
System Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) plans the implementation of all systems engineering tasks and defines the responsibilities of all participants.
The document is intended to be a living document, starting as an outline and constantly being elaborated as the system development goes on.

The most important function of the SEMP is to ensure that all participants in AreaAware knows their responsibilities to one another. 

The SEMP will describe a detailed statement of how the system engineering functions are to be carried out in the course of system development and serve as an instrument for comparing the planned tasks with the tasks accomplished.

\section{Overview}
The following series of questions regarding AreaAware will be addressed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What system will be delivered?
    \item What tasks must be accomplished to deliver the system?
    \item What is the order in which the tasks must be completed?
    \item What are the task dependencies?
    \item Who will be responsible for each task?
    \item How will each task be carried out?
    \item What are the final acceptance criteria?
\end{itemize}
