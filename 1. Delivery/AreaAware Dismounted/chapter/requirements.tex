\chapter{Requirements}
This chapter on system requirements is organised into a number of sections. Both functional and non-functional requirements will be explained throughout this chapter.

Every requirement has a project-unique identifier to support testing and traceability.

\section{Scope}
The goal of the system is to handle civilian crisis's in a more effective way. 

\subsection{Identification}
To support the goal defined in the scope a system-of-interest will be developed. Based on the goal a system that gives the dismounted emergency mangement actor a common operational picture (COP) will be described throughout this document. The dismounted COP should make it easier to plan and evaluate a civilian crisis. It should also allow for better communication will multiple actors during a crisis.

This section includes a full identification of the system-of-interest to which this document applies.
\myFigure{actorContextDiagram.png}{Actor context diagram}{asdfq}{0.7} 

AreaAware Dismounted will include the development of a portable COP for the dismounted emergency management actor. AreaAware Dismounted will communicate with AreaAware Hq through the deinfed standard network used in these scenarios This network is called SINE(Sikkerhednetværket) and it follows an international standard for communication called TETRA which is used during crisis situations world wide. 

\subsection{System overview}
AreaAware dismounted will communicate with the already employed system used by emergency management actors and it will also communicate with AreaAware Hq. Emergency Mangement actors use the SINE network during crisis situations.

The system will facilitate the commander in:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Give a demographic overview of the crisis area
	\item Let the dismounted emergency management actor locate events, things of interest and actors in the area
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Document overview}
\label{sec_documentOverview}
This document will describe the functional and non-functional requirement of the system of interest. 

The functional requirement is described using Task descriptions. These requirements describes what the system should be able to do. Task descriptions includes a Task name, the purpose of the Task and might include a precondition for the Task. The purpose should reflect the goals stated. The Tasks are furthermore described with sub-tasks that elaborates on the behavior of the system and user.  Variants are described to explain alternatives to the main sub-tasks. \citep{taskDescription}

The non-functional requirements are divided up in sub-sections and categorized. The sub-sections used follows the template given from the SECaseBook part 2. \citep{casebook}


%\section{Required states and modes}
%If the system is required to operate in multiple states or modes, these states and modes shall be defined.

\section{System capability requirement}
This section specifies requirements on the behaviour of the system. The behaviour is described with using Task descriptions explained in document overview \ref{sec_documentOverview}

\section{System external interface requirements}
This section will describe the system’s external interfaces. Interfaces will be assigned a project-unique identifier. 

The system will communicate with the system used by the Emergency Mangement Actors during a civil crisis. This network is called SINE. The interface will be provided by SINE and AreaAware Dismounted will follow the given interface to allow for SINE certification. AreaAware Dismounted will furthermore be able to communicate with AreaAware Hq. The diagram shown on figure \ref{fig:externalInterface} explains the external interfaces of AreaAware Hq.

\subsection{Software Warranty Service consists of:}
Defect Reporting. For Critical Defects, the Customer will have 24x7 access to the Service Centre by e-mail or phone to request defect repair, as described below. “Critical Defect means that the
application is down or is at high risk, business functions cannot be conducted, or the Customer is experiencing continual failures or data corruption as a result of the defect. To report non-critical
defects, the Customer will have e-mail or phone access to the Service Centre during the Principal Period of Maintenance (”PPM”), which is 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., local time, Monday through Friday,
excluding local holidays. Defect Repair. Defect repair includes verification of the existence of a defect, determination of the
severity or impact of the defect, and determination of the conditions under which the defect may recur. 
The Company will, at its option: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item For a Critical Defect, commence action within a 2-shift hour response window using commercially reasonable efforts to provide an immediate fix or temporary solution of, or workaround
	to, the defect.
	\item For a non-critical defect, commence action within an 8-shift hour response window to provide either the action described for a Critical Defect or a statement that the defect will be corrected
	in a software product revision or a future software release.
	\item Provide a statement that the Software operates as described in then-current user documentation or that the defect arises when such Software is used other than in a manner for which it
	was designed. For Software added to an installed System, warranty service must be upgraded to the same software support plan, if any, as that of the Software already installed on that
	System. Customer will pay the difference between standard warranty and upgraded warranty
	service.
