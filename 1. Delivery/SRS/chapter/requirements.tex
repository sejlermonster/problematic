\chapter{Requirements}
This chapter on system requirements is organised into a number of sections. Both functional and non-functional requirements will be explained throughout this chapter.

Every requirement has a project-unique identifier to support testing and traceability.

\section{Scope}
The goal of the system is to handle civilian crisis in a more effective way. 

\subsection{Identification}
To support the goal defined in the scope a system will be developed. The system gives a common operation picture(COP) for a commander. This makes it easier to plan and evaluate a civilian crisis and send commands to actors working in the field.

This section includes a full identification of the system-of-interest to which this document applies.

\subsection{System overview}
The system of interest will communicate with already employed system from relevant actors. This could be Police, Hospitals, Armed forces, Emergency Mangement.

The system will facilitate the commander in:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Give a demographic overview of the crisis area
	\item Let him locate events, things of interest and actors in the area
	\item Let the commander send commands to actors in the area.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Document overview}
Summarize the purpose and the content of the document. Security and privacy considerations associated with the use of this document might be added.

%\section{Required states and modes}
%If the system is required to operate in multiple states or modes, these states and modes shall be defined.

\section{System capability requirement}
This paragraph specifies requirements on the behavior of the system and shall include applicable relevant parameters. It shall be divided further into subparagraphs depending on the system capability in question

\section{System external interface requirements}
This paragraphs shall be divided into subparagraphs to specify the requirements, if any, for the system’s external interfaces. Interfaces shall be assigned a project-unique identifier. One or more interface diagrams shall be provided.

The system will communicate with the system used by the Police, Hospitals, Emergency Management and Armed forces. An interface will be defined for communication with these systems. The relation with the system is described in \ref{fig:externalInterface}.

\myFigure{InterfaceDiagram.png}{External interfaces}{fig:externalInterface}{1} 

\subsection{Interfaces for platforms currently employed}
Interfaces for the system used my Police, Hopistals, Emergency Management, Armed Forces.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The employed systems must publish events to the COP system through a well-defined interface
	\item The employed system must  subscribe to message published from the COP
\end{itemize}

\section{System internal interface requirements}
This paragraph shall be divided into subparagraphs to specify the requirements, if any, for the system’s internal interfaces. It shall state if there are internal interfaces left to the design or to system requirement specifications for components. Furthermore, the description in item 3.3 also applies to internal interfaces

\subsection{Subcontracter to optional thingy...}

\section{System internal data requirements}
Requirements on data internal to the system such as databases, data files etc. shall be stated. If there are internal interfaces left to the design or to system requirement specifications for components these shall be identified.

\section{Personnel-related requirements}
This paragraphs specifies the requirements, if any, included to accommodate the number, skill levels, duty cycles, training needs, or other information about the personnel who will use or support the system.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The customer will have 24x7 access to a Service Centre as stated in \emph{Software Warranty Service}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Software Warranty Service consists of:}
Defect Reporting. For Critical Defects, the Customer will have 24x7 access to the Service Centre by e-mail or phone to request defect repair, as described below. “Critical Defect means that the
application is down or is at high risk, business functions cannot be conducted, or the Customer is experiencing continual failures or data corruption as a result of the defect. To report non-critical
defects, the Customer will have e-mail or phone access to the Service Centre during the Principal Period of Maintenance (”PPM”), which is 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., local time, Monday through Friday,
excluding local holidays. Defect Repair. Defect repair includes verification of the existence of a defect, determination of the
severity or impact of the defect, and determination of the conditions under which the defect may recur. 
The Company will, at its option: 
\begin{itemize}
\item For a Critical Defect, commence action within a 2-shift hour response window using commercially reasonable efforts to provide an immediate fix or temporary solution of, or workaround
to, the defect.
\item For a non-critical defect, commence action within an 8-shift hour response window to provide either the action described for a Critical Defect or a statement that the defect will be corrected
in a software product revision or a future software release.
\item Provide a statement that the Software operates as described in then-current user documentation or that the defect arises when such Software is used other than in a manner for which it
was designed. For Software added to an installed System, warranty service must be upgraded to the same software support plan, if any, as that of the Software already installed on that
System. Customer will pay the difference between standard warranty and upgraded warranty
service.
\end{itemize}


\section{Training-related requirements}
System requirements pertaining to training.

\begin{itemize}
	\item A user manual will be available for the Commander who uses the COP. 	
\end{itemize}


%\section{Logistics-related requirements}
%This paragraphs specifies the requirements, if  any, concerned with logistics considerations.


\section{Packaging requirements}
This paragraphs specifies the requirements, if any, for packaging, labling and handling the systems and its components for delivery.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The COT system will be available as a .exe file which can be installed on a Windows machine version 10 or above
\end{itemize}

\section{Other requirements}
Examples include requirements for system documentation
not covered in other contractural documents
