\chapter{System-wide Design Decisions}
\label{chp:system-wide}
This chapter will describe the system-wide design decisions for the CCU and pod.
The system will in this chapter be regarded as black boxes, where none of the internal components will be described.

\section{Input and output decisions}
Figure \ref{fig:in_out} describes the inputs and outputs of the CCU and the pod.

\myFigure{systemDesign/pc_ddd_io}{}{fig:in_out}{1}

\subsection{Inputs}
The inputs of the system are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hot Air:} Hot air used to generate the apropriate temperate air for adjusting the temperature within the pod.
    \item \textbf{Cold Air:} Cold air used to generate the appropriate temperate air for adjusting the temperature within the pod.
    \item \textbf{Power:} Power for the CCU to be operational.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outputs}
The outputs of the system are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Disposal Air:} Air outtake of the pod, this is done to avoid overpressure within the pod when the temperate air in sent in.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection{Internal signals}
The internal signals of the system are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temperature:} Temperature measurement within the pod.
    \item \textbf{Temperate Air:} The temperate air sent to the pod to control the temperature within the pod.
\end{itemize}


\section{Design and construction choices}
% pod'en skal v√¶re formet som en stor fed pikkemand pikkemand pikkemand
This sections will cover some design and construction choices regarding the pod and the CCU.
Some of these choices are given by Company E through the documents \pcsow \space and \momPrimeOne.

\subsection{Pod}
The pod is bounded by the follow physical design decisions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{D-POD-01:} The pod will be mounted to the aircraft, underneath the left wing, with 4 standard T-hooks spaced by 33,02 cm in a square formation.
    \item \textbf{D-POD-02:} The external pod interfaces (i.e. interface; 01-SYS-FDR, 03-COM-MWS, 04-SEN-ERAN \& 05-CU-MWS) will be accessible in the center of the T-hook square.
    \item \textbf{D-POD-03:} The pod will have 4 dispense openings (25 cm long and 10 cm wide). One on each side, both facing downwards in a 20 degree angle of the bottom of the aircraft wing. One opening in the front, and one at the bottom of the pod.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CCU}
The CCU is bounded by the follow physical design decisions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{D-CCU-01:} The temperature regulation will be performed by temperate air flowing through the pod.
\end{itemize}
