\section{Anomaly reporting and resolution}
If an anomaly is discovered this must be reported and resolved. An anomaly could be found in documentation or the produced system.

The discovery of the anomaly must reported to the quality assurance manager. This is done through the internal anomaly reporting system. After reporting it is the responsible of the quality assurance manager to make sure the anomaly is solved.

\section{Task iteration policy}
The system will change due to the result of anomaly, correction, requirement changes ect. Changes must be reported in a proper way so that every person related to the change is informed.

The system engineers responsible for keeping the documents up to date must be informed of such changes. It is then the responsible of the system engineer team related to AreaAware to trace the change to every document. It is also the responsibility of the system engineer team to make sure relevant teams are informed.
