\section{Tests}
Differenet tests will be used for verification of the AreaAware System. The following test methods will be used:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Component testing
	\item Integration testing
	\item System testing
	\item Acceptance testing



\end{itemize}

The sequence of test is expected to be as shown in figure \ref{fig:overview}. Unit tests will be produced in the production by the developers. Integreation tests

The unit test plan, system test plan and integration test plan will be improved internally while the Acceptance test plan must be approved by the customer. 

\subsection{Component testing}
Verify the implementation of on software component/unit/element. The purpose of this is to ensure the component is developed correctly and follows the design. 

\subsection{Integration testing}
Integrating multiple components and test together. Should be done whenever possible and until the whole system has been integrated. 

\subsection{System testing}
During a system test it will be tested if the system meets the requirement specification. This is an internal testing fase and does not require a customers approval. 

\subsection{Acceptance testing}
During an acceptance test it will be tested if the system meets the requirement specification.. Acceptance test must be approved by the customer. The purpose is to ensure that the customer requirement objective are met and that the customer is satisfied.
