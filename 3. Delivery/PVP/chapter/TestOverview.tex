\section{Tests}
Differenet tests will be used for verification of the AreaAware System. The following test methods will be used:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Component testing
	\item Integration testing
	\item System testing
	\item Acceptance testing



\end{itemize}

The sequence of tests is expected to be as shown in figure \ref{fig:overview}. Unit tests will be produced in the development and production by the developers and approved by the responsible team leader. 
The project manager will perform the integration tests in collaboration with the appropriate team leaders.
The System test will be performed by the project manager under the supervision of the Quality Assurance Manager.
The Quality Assurance Manager is responsible for performing an acceptance test with the customer when the system is delivered.

The component test plan, system test plan and integration test plan will be approved internally while the Acceptance test plan must be approved by the customer. 

\subsection{Component testing}
Verify the implementation of on software component/unit/element. The purpose of this is to ensure the component is developed correctly and follows the design and requirements. 

\subsection{Integration testing}
Integrating multiple components and test together. Should be done whenever possible and until the whole system has been integrated. \\
The purpose of this is to ensure that the system components follow their interface specifications.

\subsection{System testing}
During a system test it will be tested if the system meets the requirement specification. This is an internal testing fase and does not require a customers approval.

\subsection{Acceptance testing}
During an acceptance test it will be tested if the system meets the requirement specification.. Acceptance test must be approved by the customer. The purpose is to ensure that the customer requirement objectives are met and that the customer is satisfied.
