\chapter{Architectural Design}
\label{chp:architectural}

This chapter will describe the system architecture design.
The system architecture design is described by its components, concept of execution and interfaces.


\section{System Components}
AreaAware consists the main components:
\begin{itemize}
\item AreaAware Dismounted
\item AreaAware HQ
\item AreaAware Server
\end{itemize}
To one AreaAware, can various AreaAware Dismounted and AreaAware HQ exists within (least one AreaAware HQ though), but only a single AreaAware Server.
