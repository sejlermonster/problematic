\section{Identification}

AreaAware will give the Emergency Commander a Common operation picture. THe system will communicate with devices already used in civil crisis scenarios. AreaAwarewill communicate over the defined standard network used in these scenarios. This
network is called SINE(Sikkerhednetv√¶rket) and it follows an international standard for communication called TETRA which is used during crisis situations world wide.

\section{System overview}
The system of interest will communicate with the already employed system used by Emergency Responders. Emergency Responders use the SINE network during crisis situations. The system will facilitate the Emergency Commander in:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  Give a demographic overview of the crisis area
	\item Let the commander locate events, things of interest and actors in the area.
	\item Let the commander send commands to actors in the area.
\end{itemize}

The system will let Emergency Commanders plug their own laptop(not provided) to the AreaAware Hq. By plugging their laptop to the AreaAware Hq they will be allowed access to the common operation picture through a web application. The web application will be accessed through a browser installed on the customers own laptops


\section{Document overview}
This document will describe the internal and external interfaces of the system.
